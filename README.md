# 🕰️ ChronosGuru  
**History Narrated by the People Who Lived It**  

ChronosGuru transforms the way we learn history by allowing users to *converse* with historical figures.  
Instead of memorizing dates, students engage in natural conversations — making history **interesting**, **memorable**, and **personally meaningful**. 

---

## 🎯 Problem
Traditional history education often feels:
- **Boring**
- **Lecture-heavy**
- **Passive**, encouraging memorization instead of understanding  

As a result, learners forget the lessons that matter most.

---

## 💡 Our Solution
ChronosGuru enables **interactive dialogue** with historical characters, bringing the past to life.
